# Smart Water Monitoring System

This is a smart water monitoring system that utilizes various sensors to measure and track water quality parameters such as temperature, pH level, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. The data collected from these sensors is transmitted to a microcontroller that processes the information and sends it to a cloud database for storage and analysis. The system is designed to provide real-time monitoring of water quality and alert users in case of any deviations from the set standards.
